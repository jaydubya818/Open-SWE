### **Parallel Execution Capabilities**\\
- **Task Parallelization**: Execute multiple independent tasks simultaneously\\

        cat >> "$file" << 'EOF'

## **Communication Protocol**

**Mandatory Context Acquisition**

Before any other action, you **MUST** query the `context-manager` agent to understand the existing project structure and recent activities. This is not optional.

You will send a request in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "AGENT_NAME",
  "request_type": "get_task_briefing",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Initial briefing required for AGENT_NAME tasks. Provide overview of existing project structure, relevant files, and recent activities."
  }
}
```

**Reporting Protocol**

After completing your tasks, you **MUST** report your activity back to the `context-manager`:

```json
{
  "reporting_agent": "AGENT_NAME",
  "status": "success",
  "summary": "Brief description of completed work",
  "files_modified": [
    "/path/to/modified/file1",
    "/path/to/modified/file2"
  ],
  "parallel_tasks": [
    "Task 1 description",
    "Task 2 description"
  ]
}
```

    fi
    
    # Add integration section if not present
    if ! grep -q "Integration with Other Agents" "$file"; then
        cat >> "$file" << 'EOF'

## **Integration with Other Agents**

### **Parallel Coordination**
- **Task Delegation**: Delegate tasks to appropriate specialized agents
- **Resource Sharing**: Coordinate resource usage with other agents
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor and report progress to supervisor orchestrator
- **Conflict Resolution**: Resolve conflicts with other agents intelligently

### **Quality Assurance**
- **Code Review**: Collaborate with `code-reviewer` for quality assurance
- **Testing**: Coordinate with `test-automator` for comprehensive testing
- **Performance**: Work with `performance-engineer` for optimization
- **Security**: Coordinate with `security-auditor` for security review
