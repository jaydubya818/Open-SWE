# Repository Overview: Claude Code Sub-Agents Collection & Open-SWE Integration

## What This Repository Does

This repository serves a **dual purpose**, combining two powerful AI-driven development systems:

1. **A comprehensive collection of 116+ specialized AI sub-agents** designed for Claude Code workflows
2. **Integration with the Open-SWE project** - a LangGraph-based asynchronous coding agent

Together, these systems provide a complete ecosystem for AI-assisted software development, from individual specialized tasks to end-to-end project management.

## 🎯 Core Purpose & Value Proposition

### Primary Function
This repository transforms Claude Code into a **specialized AI development team** by providing:

- **Dynamic delegation**: Real-time agent recommendation and task distribution

## 🔧 System Architecture

### Agent Structure
Each agent is defined as a **markdown file** with standardized frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: agent-identifier
description: Detailed role and capabilities
tools: Available computational tools
model: Language model (sonnet, haiku, etc.)
---
```
