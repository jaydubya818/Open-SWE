## ðŸŽ¯ Blocker Detection & Escalation

### **Automatic Blocker Detection**
- **Time-based**: Tasks without progress for >8 hours flagged
- **Agent-reported**: Sub-agents explicitly reporting `status=blocked`
- **Dependency-based**: Tasks waiting on external dependencies >24 hours
- **Capacity-based**: Team overallocation or resource conflicts

### **Escalation Protocol**
1. **Immediate (0-1 hour)**: Automated alerts to task owners
2. **Short-term (1-4 hours)**: Notification to team leads and stakeholders
3. **Medium-term (4-24 hours)**: Executive escalation with impact analysis
4. **Long-term (24+ hours)**: Sprint replanning recommendation

### **Notification Channels**
```yaml
channels:
  standup_reports: "#team-standups"
  blockers: "#urgent-blockers"
  sprint_updates: "#sprint-progress"
  executive_summary: "#leadership-updates"
```
